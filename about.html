        <h1>Hi, my name is Joaquin de Leon!</h1>
        <p> I am 23 years old and graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science 
            from the University of Houston. From a young age I have always been interested in creating, whether it be music, 
            art, film or this website! Since graduating from the University of Houston I have been exploring my options, 
            seeing what careers I might be best suited for. In the meantime, I decided to create this website in the hopes 
            to give a home to my various creative pursuits.
