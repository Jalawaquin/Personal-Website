        <h1> Hi, my name is Joaquin de Leon! </h1>
        <p> I am 23 years old and graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from the University of Houston. 
          I also graduated high school with both my diploma as well as an Associates of Arts from Houston Community College. 
          From a young age I have always been interested in creating, whether it be music, art, film or this website! 
          Since graduating from the University of Houston I have been exploring my options, seeing what careers 
          I might be best suited for. In the meantime, I decided to create this website in the hopes to give a 
          home to my various creative pursuits.
